convertmdinfo

ABOUT

HDR10 video needs certain information to be decoded correctly. HEVC
stores that information using SEI messages. One slice of that
information is the mastering display metadata that you must specify to
your HEVC encoder. Normally this data is available in cd/m², however
the HEVC encoder x265 uses its own format. This is where convertmdinfo
comes in handy as it simply let's you specify your mastering display
metadata in cd/m². Your input will then be converted to a string
that can be passed directly to x265's --master-display option.

BUILD

You can build convertmdinfo using cmake. As the program uses one
function that is not available in standard C, but specified in POSIX,
you must build it on a POSIX compatible platform.

MANUAL

A manual exists as man page in the folder man.
